# HanoiWorld

HanoiWorld is a **driving simulation benchmark** built on top of **DreamerV3 (PyTorch)**.  
It is designed to evaluate **world models** and **representation learning methods** (JEPA, RSSM, VQ-VAE) in structured urban driving scenarios.

---

## 🔗 Repository Integrations
- **DreamerV3-Torch** for world model learning and planning  
- **JEPA-based encoders** for representation learning  
- **Custom driving environments** inspired by real-world traffic scenarios  

---

## 🌍 Environments

HanoiWorld provides three driving environments, each targeting different planning and perception challenges:

envs/
├── highway/       # High-speed lane keeping and collision avoidance
├── roundabout/    # Multi-agent interaction and yielding behavior
└── merge/         # Lane merging and gap acceptance

### Environment Overview

| Environment | Key Challenges |
|-------------|----------------|
| Highway     | Long-horizon stability, collision avoidance |
| Roundabout  | Multi-agent reasoning, right-of-way |
| Merge       | Decision making under uncertainty |

Each environment provides:
- Image observations  
- Structured metadata (collision, off-road, goal reached)  
- Continuous control actions  

---

## 🧠 Methods

Supported world model components:
- **RSSM** (Recurrent State Space Model) — temporal latent dynamics  
- **JEPA** (Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture) — self-supervised visual representation learning  
- **VQ-VAE** (optional baseline) — discrete latent representations  

💡 Models are typically **pretrained** and then plugged into Dreamer for evaluation, not retrained end-to-end.

## 🚀 Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.11  
- PyTorch (CUDA recommended)  
- Gymnasium-compatible environments  

### Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
🏋️ Training
Train DreamerV3 on a HanoiWorld environment:


python dreamer.py \
  --configs hanoiworld \
  --task highway \
  --logdir ./logdir/highway
Monitor training with TensorBoard:

tensorboard --logdir ./logdir
⚠️ In most experiments, JEPA models are pretrained and reused for evaluation.
```

## 📊 Evaluation
Evaluate a pretrained JEPA + RSSM model inside Dreamer.

### Metrics
Collision rate

Off-road rate

Success rate

Mean lateral deviation

minADE (trajectory error)

Driving score

## 🧩 DreamerV3 Integration
This project is based on the PyTorch implementation of DreamerV3:

Original repository:
https://github.com/Min34r/dreamerv3-torch

Dreamer components (RSSM, actor, critic, imagination) remain largely unchanged.
Custom logic is introduced via:

Encoder replacement (JEPA)

Environment wrappers

Evaluation scripts
